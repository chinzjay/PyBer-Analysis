# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project is to analyze how the ride-sharing data differs by city type by creating a Summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results:
Fig 1 shows the Summary Data Frame of the ride sharing dat aby city type. We can see from the table that 
- The total number of rides in Urban(1625) is the highest compared to the number of rides at SubUrban(625) and Rural(125).
- The number of drivers is the highest(78) at Urban when compared to Suburban(490) and Rural(2405).
- The total Fares at Urban is the highest compared to the Total Fares at SuuUrban and Rural.
